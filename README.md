## Thoughts
An algorithm is a series of steps that perform tasks or calculations in order to solve a problem. Although the term is typically used in computing, it can apply elsewhere, such as with the case of the Pyraminx and Pyraminx Duo.

Solving a Pyraminx requires the use of many different algorithms. This challenge has not only taught me how to solve one without reading instructions (and thus not worry about what pieces have already been solved), but it has also enabled me to further deepen my understanding of the concept of algorithms.

I personally liked the gradual ease of solving a Pyraminx, especially without instructions. That being said, I thought that the Pyraminx Duo was a little more rigid to handle compared to the Pyraminx, which may have slightly slowed me down.
